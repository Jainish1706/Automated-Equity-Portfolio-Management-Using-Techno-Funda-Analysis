# Automated Equity Portfolio Management Using Techno-Funda Analysis

This repository contains the Python-based implementation for **Automated Equity Portfolio Management** using an integrated **Techno-Funda Analysis** approach. The project was developed as part of the experimental research presented at **NICOM 2025, Nirma University**.

## üìÑ Abstract

The research explores a dynamic framework for equity portfolio management, combining **fundamental** and **technical analysis** to create and manage optimal stock portfolios. Stocks from the **NIFTY 100 index** are screened based on financial metrics, technical indicators, and optimization techniques like **Efficient Frontier** and **Monte Carlo Simulations**. The strategy automates stock selection, portfolio optimization, and trading decisions using Python, ensuring a continuous closed-loop system for real-time adjustments.

## üöÄ Features

- **Data Sources**: 
  - Financial metrics (e.g., Revenue, EPS, PE ratio) via Screener.in.
  - Historical stock prices via Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`).

- **Fundamental Analysis**:
  - Screening based on CAGR, EBITDA margins, and projected PE ratios.
  - Ranking stocks for portfolio inclusion.

- **Portfolio Optimization**:
  - Efficient Frontier analysis for risk-return optimization.
  - Monte Carlo Simulations to maximize Sharpe Ratio.

- **Technical Analysis**:
  - Entry/Exit signals using:
    - EMA Crossovers (e.g., EMA 20-50, EMA 9-15).
    - ADX slopes and RSI thresholds.

- **Performance Evaluation**:
  - Extended Internal Rate of Return (XIRR) for trading performance.
  - Comparison with benchmark returns (NIFTY 100).

   - Rank top 30 stocks for portfolio consideration.
3. **Portfolio Optimization**:
   - Use Monte Carlo Simulations and Efficient Frontier to allocate weights.
4. **Technical Entry/Exit**:
   - Apply technical indicators for trading decisions.
5. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Calculate XIRR for portfolio stocks and compare with benchmarks.
6. **Dynamic Updates**:
   - Automatically update the portfolio with new financial data and technical signals.
